## What is Ozone?
Ozone (/ËˆoÊŠzoÊŠn/), or trioxygen, is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O
3. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O
2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O
2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

## Why OSMA?
OSMA's goal is to prevent ozone's harmfulness and aware the danger. Relatively low amounts of ozone can cause chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and, throat irritation.
